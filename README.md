Overall, the experiment sets conducted in the context of this project can be divided into two main classes: 

* The first class of experiments: only past observed values of the input variables (water levels and rainfall magnitudes) were used as input. A traditional LSTM
model was used for this set of experiments: <a href = "https://github.com/RimMehdbi/Data-driven-flash-flood-modeling-/blob/main/FinalFlashFloodPredictionFramework_FutureObservedRainfall_Encoder_Decoder_LSTM_2013.ipynb">Link</a>.

* The second class of experiments:  past observed values of the input variables (water levels and rainfall magnitudes) as well as rainfall forecasts were used as input. 
An encoder-decoder LSTM model was devised for this set of experiments: <a  href ="https://github.com/RimMehdbi/Data-driven-flash-flood-modeling-/blob/main/FinalFlashFloodPredictionFramework_FutureObservedRainfall_Encoder_Decoder_LSTM_2013.ipynb">Link</a>.

The models were created for four years with different hydrological characteristics.
